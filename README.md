# Machine-Learning
This Machine Learning Repo contains BreastCancer Classification approaches

INTRODUCTION TO BREAST CANCER

The goal of the project is a medical data analysis using artificial intelligence methods such as machine learning and deep learning for classifying cancers (malignant or benign). Breast cancer is the most common cancer occurring among women, and this is also the main reason for dying from cancer in the world. The most effective way to reduce numbers of death is early detection.


Machine learning allows to precision and fast classification of breast cancer based on numerical data (in our case) and images without leaving home e.g. for a surgical biopsy.

DATA USED FOR THE PROJECT

For the project, I used a breast cancer dataset from Wisconsin University. The dataset contains 569 samples and 30 features computed from digital images. Each sample identifies parameters of each patient.

PYTHON PACKAGES
I work daily with Python 3.6+ using a few packages to simplify everyday tasks in data science.

Below are the most important ones.

scikit-learn is a library for machine learning algorithms
Pandas is used for data processing
Seaborn is used for data visualization
